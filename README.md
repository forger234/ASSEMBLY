# Assembly Language Programs

This repository contains a collection of basic assembly language programs written for educational purposes. Each program demonstrates a fundamental operation such as arithmetic, logic, or data manipulation, using low-level x86 assembly instructions.

## 📁 Files and Descriptions

| File Name      | Description                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| `ADDITION.ASM` | Adds two numbers               |
| `SUB.ASM`      | Subtracts one number from another |
| `LARGEST.ASM`  | Finds the largest number in a list |
| `REVERSE.ASM`  | Reverses an array or string     |
| `SORT.ASM`     | Sorts elements in ascending order |
| `SEARCH.ASM`   | Searches for an element in a list |
| `DISPLAY.ASM`  | Displays output to screen       |
| `README.md`    | Project description and info    |

## 🛠️ Requirements

- x86 compatible assembler (e.g., **TASM**, **MASM**, or **NASM**)
- DOSBox (if running on a modern system)
- Basic understanding of assembly language and registers

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Assemble the file using your assembler:
   ```bash
   tasm ADDITION.ASM
   tlink ADDITION.OBJ
2.Run the resulting .EXE or .COM file inside DOSBox or compatible environment.
